(defmacro build-query
  "For the given SQL query `q` and substitution map performs pattern interpolation.
  If multiple arguments are given the last one will be treated as substitution map.

  Tries to convert possible literals given as query parts to strings and then trim
  them while squeezing repeated spaces at compile time. If some operation cannot be
  performed in that phase, it generates code which will convert an expression to a
  string at runtime. Then pattern interpolation is performed on the resulting string,
  using the provided `substitutions` map.

  If a source string contains `%{tag-name}` special pattern, `tag-name` will be
  looked up in substitution map and the whole pattern will be replaced by the
  corresponding value.

  If a tag name from pattern cannot be found in a substitution map, the pattern will
  be replaced by an empty string.

  A pattern may have a form of `%%{tag-name}`. In such case any non-`nil` value being
  a result of tag name resolution will be quoted using `io.randomseed.utils.db.sql/quote`.

  A synonym of `%%table{tag-name}` is `%[table-name]`.
  A synonym of `%%column{tag-name}` is `%(column-name)`.
  A synonym of `%%colspec{tag-name}` is `%<column-table-specification>`.

  A pattern may have additional modifier before the opening brace. It will be
  resolved as a symbolic function name to be called in order to transform a value
  associated with a tag name. If the name is not fully-qualified (does not contain a
  namespace part) its default namespace will be set to `io.randomseed.utils.db.sql`.

  There is a special pattern using `%SOME` tag:
  - `%SOME? variable:has-value#no-value` or
  - `%SOME? variable:has-value`

  It performs a substitution with `has-value` string if `variable` exists and is not
  `nil` and not `false`; otherwise it performs a substitution with `no-value` string
  or an empty string if the `no-value` was not given.

  There is also an additional pattern `%'column-table-specification'` which is a
  quotation pattern. It uses `colspec-quoted` function on a given text.

  Example:

  ```
  (build-query \"select %%column{id} from %%table{users}\"
               \"where\" :points '> 100
               {:id    :users/id
                :users :users/id})
  ```

  The above call will generate the following result:

  ```
  \"select `id` from `users` where points > 100\"
  ```

  This is synonymous to:

  ```
  (build-query \"select %(id) from %[users]\"
               \"where\" :points '> 100
               {:id    :users/id
                :users :users/id})
  ```

  This macro can optionally be called with a single literal sequence given as its
  first and only argument. In such cache the sequence should contain all arguments,
  including a substitution map, if applicable.

  This macro should NOT be used to dynamically generate queries having thousands of
  variant substitution parameters as it uses unlimited underlying cache. For such
  purposes please use `build-query-dynamic`, or simply utilize parameters of prepared
  statements.

;; Grouped sequences processing

(defn groups-inverter
  "Helper function for transforming a map of sequences keyed with keywords into a map
  of elements found in those sequences (as keys) associated with results of calling a
  function on them with additional arguments, including original map's keys.

  In other words: transforms results of `clojure.core/group-by` into a single map,
  changing values found in sequences into keys, and associating values to those keys
  resulting from calling a function.

  Takes a function `f` and additional arguments (zero or more), and returns a
  function which takes a map `m`, identity type `id-type` and a sequence of
  identifiers `ids`, and calls `f` with all arguments and `id-type` passed on the
  sequence. Then it calls `clojure.core/into` to put the result of calling `f` into a
  map `m`.

  Example: `(groups-inverter get-ids db)`

  In this example a function will be returned, similar to the below:

  `(fn [m id-type ids] (into m (get-ids db id-type)))`.

  It is used mainly as a transformer in `reduce-kv` when dealing with multiple user
  identifiers grouped by identity type. Having a map of vectors grouped by identity
  type:

  ```
  {:email [#io.randomseed.utils.identity.types.Identity{:id-type :email :value \"pw@gnu.org\"}],
   :id    [#io.randomseed.utils.identity.types.Identity{:id-type :id    :value 1}
           #io.randomseed.utils.identity.types.Identity{:id-type :id,   :value 42}]}
  ```

  we can call `(reduce-kv (groups-inverter get-ids db) {})` to get:

  ```
  {#io.randomseed.utils.identity.types.Identity{:id-type :id,    :value 1}               1
   #io.randomseed.utils.identity.types.Identity{:id-type :id,    :value 42}             42
   #io.randomseed.utils.identity.types.Identity{:id-type :email, :value \"pw@gnu.org\"} 1}
  ```

  The `get-ids` will be called for each identity group, receiving a list of
  identities and passed arguments with identity type. After getting numerical user
  identifiers it will associate them with identity objects in a map."
